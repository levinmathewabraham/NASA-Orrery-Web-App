            <p class="lead">
              Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, 
              such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use 
              numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical 
              counterparts. Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that is embedded in a webpage and 
              displays celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
              <br><br>
              An orrery can depict many types of celestial bodies including planets, Near-Earth Comets (NEC), Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA), 
              and a subset of NEA called Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHA). Collectively, NEA, NEC, and PHA are known as Near-Earth Objects 
              (NEO). A static orrery is an interactive 3D model that presents the position of celestial bodies, such as planets and NEOs, relative 
              to the Sun, while a dynamic orrery is animated such that the positions of the celestial bodies change over a period of time.
              <br><br>
              Numerous NASA resources relevant to this challenge are publicly available, including a database to obtain the data needed to 
              determine the position of planets and NEO, tutorials to help you learn how to plot and simulate an orbit, an example orrery that 
              presents PHA, approximate Keplerian parameters for the planets, a small-body database that provides Keplerian parameters, and more.
